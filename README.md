# ddl - Dominicana DotA League

![October15-Landing](http://s1.postimg.org/utxnyxojz/ddl_home.png)

DDL is a web based In-House ranking system built in Rails for the Dominican DotA community and supported by the players from the Stomp Machine community.

The application was built using Facebook's omniauth, puma, PostgreSQL and it's tested with RSpec. 
Readme is still under construction and I'll try to go into the specifics soon. 

You can check the web application running live by visiting http://ddl.do .
